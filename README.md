# QR Code Pixelated Antenna MFA

Welcome to **QR Code Pixelated Antenna MFA**, a neat project that takes two-factor authentication to the next level by combining a standard QR code with a unique RF-responsive antenna pattern. It’s all about verifying both what you see—and your physical presence. Perfect for adding an extra layer of security to wireless systems, IoT devices, and access control setups.

##  Why This Exists

Tired of relying on just visual cues like QR codes—where a screen or photo might trick the system? This project ensures you’re not only scanning what’s expected but that you're actually *there* with a matching RF antenna. It's like turning a one-dimensional code into a real-world handshake.

##  What You’ll Find Here

- Core Django (or similar) setup with folders like:
- admins/
- assists/
- media/
- qrcodepixelated/
- users/
- manage.py
- Dockerfile
- deployement.yaml
- requirements.txt
- db.sqlite3
  
---

##  Quick Start

If you're curious to try it out:

- git clone https://github.com/iamomer2707/qrcode.git
- cd qrcode
- pip install -r requirements.txt   # Or use Docker if that’s your jam
- ./manage.py runserver  # Get the app running!

## Why This Matters

Most MFA systems rely on something you see (QR) + something you know (password, code). I’ve been playing with the idea of adding something you are or in this case, something you physically have—in the form of this RF-responsive antenna. It’s a small hardware step toward making authentication feel real-world real.

## Want to Contribute?

Absolutely! Whether it's refining the RF logic, improving the UI, or testing it with different antenna designs I’d love your help. Fork it, give it a spin, and open up a pull request with your ideas.

## Licensing & Contact

I’m leaning toward making this open source under MIT—because more people testing and improving never hurts. Want to chat about ideas, improvements, or real-world use cases? Drop me a message right here on GitHub!

Thanks a bunch for checking this out—let’s make authentication more secure and a bit more fun.
